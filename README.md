## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker (for MongoDB)

### Database Setup (MongoDB)

1. **Start MongoDB using Docker:**
   ```bash
   # Make the setup script executable
   chmod +x setup-mongodb.sh
   
   # Run the setup script
   ./setup-mongodb.sh
   ```

2. **Alternative: Manual Docker setup:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d mongodb
   ```

3. **Alternative: Local MongoDB installation:**
   ```bash
   # macOS with Homebrew
   brew install mongodb-community
   brew services start mongodb-community
   ```

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create environment file (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your JWT secret key

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Quick Start

Use the provided script to start both services:

```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x start_new.sh
./start_new.sh
```

This will start:
- MongoDB (Docker)
- Backend API (http://localhost:8000)
- Frontend (http://localhost:5173)

### Initialize with UNC Course Data

To populate the database with real UNC course data for testing:

```bash
# Initialize database with sample UNC courses and ratings
./scripts/initialize_db.sh
```

This adds:
- **8 UNC majors** (Art, Applied Sciences, Biology, Computer Science, Data Science, Economics, Business Administration, Neuroscience)
- **288+ real UNC courses** with actual course codes and names
- **580+ class difficulty ratings** (1-10 scale)
- **1,280+ professor reviews** with realistic ratings
- **40 sample professors** teaching across different courses

## Usage

1. **Register/Login:** Use your UNC email address to create an account
2. **Choose Major:** Select your major from the homepage
3. **Browse Ratings:** View class difficulty rankings and professor ratings
4. **Submit Ratings:** Rate classes and professors you've experienced
5. **Search:** Find specific classes using the search functionality
